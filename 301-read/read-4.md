# Grid Layout
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

Display Property
To convert html element container to grid you should change Display Property to display: grid; or inline-grid
`.container {  display: grid;}`
`.grid-container {  display: inline-grid;}`

The vertical lines of grid items are called columns.
The horizontal lines of grid items are called rows.
The spaces between each column/row are called gaps.

Some CSS Grid Properties :
`column-gap`  ,  `gap`  , `grid` , `grid-area` , `row-gap`


**Some regexr Expression :
Match any character in the set : `[ABC]`
Match any character that is not in the set : `[^ABC]`
Matches a character having a character code between the two specified characters inclusive : `[^A-Z]`
Matches any character except linebreaks. Equivalent to :
`[^\n\r].`
Matches any word character : `\w`
