# Refactoring
Functional programming is a programming paradigm a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data

### Pure functions :
It is the function that returns a new value without making any changes to the existing variables or changing the css format, meaning that this function only returns a new value , example of Pure functions :
Get random number function
Get real time function


Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve”

### Recursive Function
A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution. The process may repeat several times, outputting the result and the end of each iteration.


JavaScript supports functional programming .
